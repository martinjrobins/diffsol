# Webassembly demo using Yew and DiffSol

Most of diffsol can be compiled to WebAssembly (everything except the `diffsl-*` features). This example shows how to use DiffSol in a Yew application to simulate a simple population dynamics model.

A [demo](https://martinjrobins.github.io/diffsol/examples/population-dynamics-wasm-yew/) is available online.
