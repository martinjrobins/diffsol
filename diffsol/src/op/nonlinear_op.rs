// NonLinearOp is a trait that defines a nonlinear operator or function `F` that maps an input vector `x` to an output vector `y`, (i.e. `y = F(x, t)`).
// It extends the [Op] trait with methods for computing the operator and its Jacobian.
//
// The operator is defined by the [Self::call_inplace] method, which computes the function `F(x, t)` at a given state and time.
// The Jacobian is defined by the [Self::jac_mul_inplace] method, which computes the product of the Jacobian with a given vector `J(x, t) * v`.
